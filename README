This is the current state of my .vim folder.

To install: download archive, run make (it will back up your current .vim, .vimrc, and .gvimrc)

To update: to updates plugins run .vim/update.sh

Originally forked from https://github.com/isaacs/.vim

Note: If you have a Mac, you need a terminal that supports more colors like iTerm.
